#' kuenm2: Detailed Development of Ecological Niche Models
#'
#' kuenm2 helps with the development of critical phases of the
#' ecological niche modeling process. Data preparation analyses and
#' explorations can be done to prepare data. Model calibration (model selection)
#' can be done by creating and testing several candidate models. Handy options
#' for producing final models, evaluating such models, and assessing extrapolation
#' risks are also included. Tools for post-modeling analyses are implemented to
#' allow for further exploration of results.
