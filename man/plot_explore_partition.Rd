\arguments{
\item{explore_partition}{an object of class \code{explore_partition} returned by
the \code{explore_partition_extrapolation()} function.}

\item{space}{(character) vector specifying the space to plot. Available
options are  'G' for geographical space and E' for environmental space.
Default is c("G","E"), meaning both spaces are plotted.}

\item{type_of_plot}{(character) vector specifying the type(s) of plot.
Options are "simple", which shows whether the record in a partition is within
the range of the other partitions, and "distance", which shows the Euclidean
distance of the record to the set of conditions in the other partitions.
Default is c("simple", "distance"), meaning both plots are produced.}

\item{variables}{(character) A pair of variables used to define the axes of
the environmental space. Default is NULL, meaning the first two continuous
variables available in \code{explore_partition} are used to define the E space.}

\item{calibration_area}{(SpatRaster, SpatVector, or SpatExtent) A spatial
object representing the calibration area. Preferably, the same object
provided to \code{prepare_data}. Required only when "G" is included in
\code{type_of_plot}. Default is NULL, meaning the coordinates of the records are
used to define the calibration area.}

\item{show_limits}{(logical) whether to draw a box representing the lower and
upper limits of the variables, considering the other partitions (i.e., in
Partition 1, the box represents the limits considering Partitions 2, 3, and
4. Only applicable when "E" is included in \code{type_of_plot}. Default is TRUE.}

\item{include_background}{(logical) whether to plot background points
together with presence records. Only applicable if \code{explore_partition} was
obtained using presence and background points (i.e., with
\code{include_test_background = TRUE} in \code{explore_partition_extrapolation}).
Default is FALSE.}

\item{distance_palette}{(character) a vector of valid colors used to
interpolate a palette for representing distance. Default is NULL, meaning a
built-in palette is used (green for lower distances and red for higher
distances). Only applicable if "distance" is included in \code{type_of_plot}.}

\item{break_type}{(character) specifies the method used to define distance
breaks. Options are "pretty" or "quantile". Default is "pretty", which uses
the \code{pretty()} function to set the breaks. Only applicable if "distance" is
included in \code{type_of_plot}.}

\item{in_range_color}{(character) a color used to represent records that
fall within the range of the other partitions. Default is "#009E73" (Seafoam
Green).}

\item{out_range_color}{(character) A color used to represent records that
fall outside the range of the other partitions. Default is "#D55E00"
(reddish-orange).}

\item{calibration_area_col}{(character) A color used to represent the
calibration area. Default is "gray90".}

\item{pr_alpha}{(numeric) specifies the transparency of presence records.
Default is 1, meaning fully opaque.}

\item{bg_alpha}{(numeric) specifies the transparency of background points.
Default is 0.4. Only applicable if \code{include_background} is set to TRUE.}

\item{pch_in_range}{(numeric) specifies the symbol used for points that fall
within the range of the other partitions. Default is 21 (filled circle).
See \code{?pch} for other available options.}

\item{pch_out_range}{(numeric) specifies the symbol used for points that fall
outside the range of the other partitions. Default is 24 (filled triangle).
See \code{?pch} for other available options.}

\item{cex_plot}{(numeric) specifies the size of points in the plot. Default
is 1.4}

\item{size_text_legend}{(numeric) specifies the size of the text in the
legend. Default  is 1.}

\item{legend.margin}{(numeric) specifies the height of the row in the layout
that contains the legend. Default is 0.4, meaning the row will be 40\% the
height of the other rows in the layout.}

\item{lwd_legend}{(numeric) specifies the width of the legend bar
representing distance. Default is 12. Applicable only if "distance" is
included in \code{type_of_plot}.}

\item{ncols}{(numeric) specifies the number of columns in the plot layout.
Default is NULL, meaning the number of columns is determined automatically
based on the number of partitions.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \code{plot()}.}
