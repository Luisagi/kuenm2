## Introduction

Model calibration is the most computationally challenging process automated in **kuenm2**. In this step, candidate models are trained and tested using a k-fold cross-validation approach. Then, models are selected based on multiple criteria to warranty that the models used in later steps are the most robust among the candidates. The main function used in this step is `calibration()`.

To start the calibration process, we need a `prepared_data` object. For more details in data preparation, please refer to the vignette [prepare data for model calibration](prepared_data.html).

To start, let's create two `prepared_data` object: one using the maxnet as algorithm, and another with GLM:

```{r Create d_maxnet again, warning=FALSE}
#Load packages
library(kuenm2)
library(terra)

# Import occurrences
data(occ_data, package = "kuenm2")

# Import raster layers
var <- rast(system.file("extdata", "Current_variables.tif", package = "kuenm2"))

# Prepare data for maxnet model
d_maxnet <- prepare_data(algorithm = "maxnet",
                         occ = occ_data,
                         x = "x", y = "y",
                         raster_variables = var,
                         species = "Myrcia hatschbachii",
                         categorical_variables = "SoilType",
                         n_background = 300,
                         features = c("l", "q", "lq", "lqp"),
                         r_multiplier = c(0.1, 1, 2))

# Prepare data for glm model
d_glm <- prepare_data(algorithm = "glm",
                         occ = occ_data,
                         x = "x", y = "y",
                         raster_variables = var,
                         species = "Myrcia hatschbachii",
                         categorical_variables = "SoilType",
                         n_background = 300,
                         features = c("l", "q", "lq", "lqp"))
```

## Calibration
The `calibration()` function fits and evaluates candidate models considering the follow metrics:

- Omission error: calculated using models trained with separate testing data subsets. Users can specify multiple omission rates to be considered (e.g., c(5%, 10%)), though only one can be used as the threshold for selecting the best models.
- Partial ROC: calculated following [Peterson et al. (2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2007.11.008).
- Model complexity (AIC): assessed using models generated with the complete set of occurrences.
- Unimodality (optional): Assessed through the beta coefficients of quadratic terms, following [Arias-Giraldo & Cobos (2024)](https://journals.ku.edu/jbi/article/view/21742).

<br>

In summary, to calibrate and evaluate the models, the function requires a `prepared_data` object and the following definitions:

* **Omission Errors:** Values ranging from 0 to 100, representing the percentage of potential error attributed to various sources of uncertainty in the data. These values are utilized in the calculation of omission rates and partial ROC.
* **Omission Rate for Model Selection:** The specific omission error threshold used to select models. This value defines the maximum omission rate a candidate model can have to be considered for selection.
* **Removal of Concave Curves:** A specification of whether to exclude candidate models that exhibit concave curves.

Optional arguments allow for modifications such as changing the delta AIC threshold for model selection (default is 2), determining whether to add presence samples to the background (default is `TRUE`), and whether to employ user-specified weights. For a comprehensive description of all arguments, refer to `?calibration`.

In this example, we will evaluate the models considering two omission errors (5% and 10%), with model selection based on the 5% omission error. To improve computational speed, you can set `parallel` to `TRUE` and specify the number of cores to utilize; the candidate models will be distributed among these cores. To detect the number of available cores on your machine, run `parallel::detectCores()`.

### Maxnet Models
Let's calibrate the maxnet models:

```{r import calib_results_maxnet, echo=FALSE}
m_maxnet <- kuenm2::calib_results_maxnet
```

```{r calibrate maxnet, eval=FALSE}
#Calibrate maxnet models
m_maxnet <- calibration(data = d_maxnet, 
                 error_considered = c(5, 10),
                 omission_rate = 5,
                 parallel = FALSE, #Set TRUE to run in parallel
                 ncores = 1) #Define number of cores to run in parallel
# Task 1/1: fitting and evaluating models:
#   |=====================================================================| 100%
# 
# Model selection step:
# Selecting best among 300 models.
# Calculating pROC...
# 
# Filtering 300 models.
# Removing 0 model(s) because they failed to fit.
# 153 models were selected with omission rate below 5%.
# Selecting 2 final model(s) with delta AIC <2.
# Validating pROC of selected models...
#   |=====================================================================| 100%
# All selected models have significant pROC values.
```

The `calibration()` function returns a `calibration_results` object, a list containing various essential pieces of information from the model calibration process. The elements of the `calibration_results` object can be explored by indexing them. For example, all evaluation metrics are stored within the `calibration_results` element:
```{r explore calibration}
# See first rows of the summary of calibration results
head(m_maxnet$calibration_results$Summary[,c("ID", "Omission_rate_at_10.mean", "AICc",
                                      "Is_concave")])
```

<br>

We can also examine the details of the selected models:

```{r explore selected}
# See first rows of the summary of calibration results
m_maxnet$selected_models[,c("ID", "Formulas", "R_multiplier", 
                     "Omission_rate_at_10.mean", "AICc", "Is_concave")]
```

<br>

When printed, the `calibration_results` object provides a summary of the model selection process. This includes the total number of candidate models considered, the number of models that failed to fit, and the number of models exhibiting concave curves (along with an indication of whether these were removed). Additionally, it reports the number of models excluded due to non-significant partial ROC (pROC) values, high omission error rates, or elevated AIC values. Finally, a summary of the metrics for the selected models is presented.

```{r}
print(m_maxnet)
```

<br>

In this example, of the 300 candidate **maxnet** models fitted, two was selected based on a significant pROC value, a low omission error (<10%), and a low AIC score (<2). 

### GLM Models

Now, let's calibrate the GLM Models to see if with this algorith we achieve different selected models:

```{r import calib_results_glm, echo=FALSE}
m_glm <- kuenm2::calib_results_glm
```

```{r calibrate glm, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Calibrate maxnet models
m_glm <- calibration(data = d_glm, 
                     error_considered = c(5, 10),
                     omission_rate = 5,
                     parallel = FALSE, #Set TRUE to run in parallel
                     ncores = 1) #Define number of cores to run in parallel
# Task 1/1: fitting and evaluating models:
#   |=====================================================================| 100%
# Model selection step:
# Selecting best among 100 models.
# Calculating pROC...
# 
# Filtering 100 models.
# Removing 0 model(s) because they failed to fit.
# 50 models were selected with omission rate below 5%.
# Selecting 1 final model(s) with delta AIC <2.
# Validating pROC of selected models...
#   |=====================================================================| 100%
# All selected models have significant pROC values.
```
Now, instead of two selected models, we have only one:
```{r selected models in glm}
m_glm
```

### Concave curves

It is worth noting that with both maxnet and glm algorithm, some models were identified as having concave curves. Concave (or bimodal) curves indicate that the peak suitability is found at the extremes of the variable range. For example, as shown in the right panel of the figure below, higher suitability is observed in both the driest and wettest regions, with lower suitabilities occurring at intermediate precipitation levels.

```{r figure of concave curves, out.width="82%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes_img/concave_curves.png")
```

<br>

In our example, none of the selected models have concave curves:
```{r has concave}
#Selected maxnet models
m_maxnet$selected_models[,c("ID", "Formulas", "Is_concave")]

#Selected glm models
m_glm$selected_models[,c("ID", "Formulas", "Is_concave")]
```

<br>

However, occasionally, a model with concave curves might be selected if it has sufficiently low omission rate and AIC values. To **ensure that none of the selected models have concave curves**, you can set `remove_concave = TRUE` within the `calibration()` function. Let's test it with the maxnet algorithm:

```{r remove_concave, eval = FALSE}
m_unimodal <- calibration(data = d_maxnet, 
                          remove_concave = TRUE, # Ensures concave models are not selected
                          error_considered = c(5, 10),
                          omission_rate = 5)
# Task 1/2: checking for concave responses in models:
#   |=====================================================================| 100%
# 
# Task 2/2: fitting and evaluating models with no concave responses:
#   |=====================================================================| 100%
# 
# Model selection step:
# Selecting best among 370 models.
# Calculating pROC...
# 
# Filtering 370 models.
# Removing 0 model(s) because they failed to fit.
# Removing 105 model(s) with concave curves.
# 129 models were selected with omission rate below 5%.
# Selecting 2 final model(s) with delta AIC <2.
# Validating pROC of selected models...
#   |=====================================================================| 100%
# All selected models have significant pROC values.
```

Note that the process is now divided into two tasks:

* Task 1/2: Only candidate models that include quadratic terms are fitted. For Maxent models (using the maxnet algorithm), the function first fits the candidate model with the highest regularization multiplier (e.g., 5) for each formula. This approach is used because if a particular formula produces a concave response at a high regularization value, it will also produce concave responses at lower regularization values. By checking the model with the highest regularization first, the function can skip fitting the other models with the same formula but lower regularization values, saving time and computation.

* Task 2/2: In this step, the function fits and evaluates two groups of models:
  - Models without quadratic terms.
  - Models with quadratic terms, but only those with formulas that did not produce concave responses in Task 1/2 (i.e., they passed the concavity check at the higher regularization multiplier).
  
<br>

## Re-selecting models

The model selection procedure is conducted internally during the calibration process. However, it is possible to re-select models by considering other omission rates (since these were calculated during calibration), model complexity (delta AIC) and concave curves.

By default, `calibration()` calculates pROC values only for the selected models to optimize computational time. Consequently, pROC values for non-selected models are filled with `NA`.

```{r pROC NA}
# See first rows of the summary of calibration results (pROC values)
head(m_maxnet$calibration_results$Summary[,c("ID", "Mean_AUC_ratio_at_10.mean",
                                 "pval_pROC_at_10.mean")])
# See pROC values of selected models
m_maxnet$selected_models[,c("ID", "Mean_AUC_ratio_at_10.mean",
                                 "pval_pROC_at_10.mean")]
```
<br>

When pROC is not calculated for all models during `calibration()`, the `select_models()` function requires the `prepared_data` used during the calibration step, and `compute_proc` must be set to `TRUE`.

For instance, let's re-select the maxnet models from the calibration results, applying an omission rate of 10% instead 5%:

```{r}
#Re-select maxnet models
new_m_maxnet <- select_models(calibration_results = m_maxnet, 
                       data = d_maxnet, #Necessary for computing pROC
                       compute_proc = TRUE, 
                       omission_rate = 10) # New omission rate
print(new_m_maxnet)
```

<br>

If a `calibration_results` object is provided, `select_models()` will return a `calibration_results` output with the selected models and summary updated. Note that we now have only 1 model selected with the maxnet algoritm:

```{r selected models or5}
new_m_maxnet$selected_models[,c("ID", "Formulas", "R_multiplier", 
                     "Omission_rate_at_5.mean", "Mean_AUC_ratio_at_10.mean",
                     "AICc", "Is_concave")]
```

<br>

You can also provide a `data.frame` containing the evaluation metrics for each candidate model directly to `select_models()`. This `data.frame` is available in the output of the `calibration()` function under `object$calibration_results$Summary`. In this case, the function will return a list containing the selected models along with summaries of the model selection process.

```{r select models dataframe}
#Re-select models using data.frame
new_summary <- select_models(candidate_models = m_maxnet$calibration_results$Summary,
                             data = d_maxnet, #Necessary for computing pROC
                             compute_proc = TRUE, 
                             omission_rate = 10)

#Get class of object
class(new_summary)

#See selected models
new_summary$selected_models[,c("ID", "Formulas", "R_multiplier", 
                     "Omission_rate_at_5.mean", "Mean_AUC_ratio_at_10.mean",
                     "AICc", "Is_concave")]
```

<br>

## Saving a calibration_results object

After calibrating and selecting the best-performing models, we can proceed to fit the final models (see the vignette for model exploration) using the `calibration_results` object. As this object is essentially a list, users can save it to a local directory using `saveRDS()`. Saving the object facilitates loading it back into your R session later using `readRDS()`. See an example below:

```{r save data, eval=FALSE}
# Set directory to save (here, in a temporary directory)
dir_to_save <- file.path(tempdir())

# Save the data
saveRDS(m_maxnet, file.path(dir_to_save, "Candidates_maxnet.rds"))

# Import data
m_maxnet <- readRDS(file.path(dir_to_save, "Candidates_maxnet.rds"))
```
